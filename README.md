# UK Smoking Data Analysis

## Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of smoking-related data in the United Kingdom. The analysis focuses on understanding smoking patterns, demographic factors, and their relationships through comprehensive data visualization and statistical analysis.

## Project Structure
- `uk-smoking-eda.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis
- Data sources: Various UK smoking datasets (demographics, smoking rates, etc.)

## Analysis Components

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Handling missing values
- Data type conversions
- Feature engineering
- Outlier detection and treatment

### 2. Demographic Analysis
- Age group distributions
- Gender-based smoking patterns
- Regional variations in smoking rates
- Socioeconomic factors affecting smoking prevalence

### 3. Visualizations
- Interactive plots using Plotly
- Statistical charts and graphs
- Geographic visualizations (where applicable)
- Time series analysis of smoking trends

### 4. Key Findings
- Smoking prevalence patterns across different demographics
- Correlations between smoking and various factors
- Regional differences in smoking behavior
- Trends in smoking rates over time
